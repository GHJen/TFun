# TFun
TFun: Strike A (hand)pose uses the MediaPipe handpose model in TensorFlow.js, as well as a "Fingerpose" library, found here: https://github.com/andypotato/fingerpose to define zero through ten in ASL as gestures. The game allows you to learn ASL, or use your knowledge of those gestures to change colors or make sounds, and is served on Netlify here: https://strikeahandpose.netlify.app/
